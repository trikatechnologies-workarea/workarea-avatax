# Avatax

Avatax by Avalara provides a centralized service for tracking sales tax bills.
This plugin integrates that service into the Weblinc platform. Instead of using
the Weblinc platform's included sales tax caclulation system, it uses Avatax to
calculate sales tax. After an order is placed, that order's sales tax bill is
transmitted to Avatax. Users may choose to commit (save them so that they are
reflected in tax liability) posted documents either via Weblinc platform, or
via their own order management system.

# Installation

All you need to do is simply add the gem to your gemfile. Everything else is
configured via the admin panel.
