      # Point of sale data file generation
      # 
      # Builds a point-of-sale data file containing tax rates and rules for this location, containing tax rates for all
      # items defined for this company. This data file can be used to correctly calculate tax in the event a 
      # point-of-sale device is not able to reach AvaTax.
      # This data file can be customized for specific partner devices and usage conditions.
      # The result of this API is the file you requested in the format you requested using the 'responseType' field.
      # This API builds the file on demand, and is limited to a maximum of 7500 items.
      # 
      # @param int companyId The ID number of the company that owns this location.

      # @param string format The format of the file (JSON by default) (See PointOfSaleFileType::* for a list of allowable values)
