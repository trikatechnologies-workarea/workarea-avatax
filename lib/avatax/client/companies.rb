      # Quick setup for a company with a single physical address
      # 
      # Shortcut to quickly setup a single-physical-location company with critical information and activate it.
      # This API provides quick and simple company setup functionality and does the following things:
      #  
      # * Create a company object with its own tax profile
      # * Add a key contact person for the company
      # * Set up one physical location for the main office
      # * Declare nexus in all taxing jurisdictions for that main office address
      # * Activate the company
      #  
      # This API only provides a limited subset of functionality compared to the 'Create Company' API call. 
      # If you need additional features or options not present in this 'Quick Setup' API call, please use the full 'Create Company' call instead.

      # before approval.
